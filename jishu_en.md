### Data & Privacy

#### Q: Where is my data stored?
**A:** All your data is stored locally on your device. LifeGo does not transmit any information to external servers or cloud services. Your data never leaves your device.

#### Q: Is my data secure?
**A:** Yes. Since all data stays on your device, your data security depends on your device's security measures. We recommend:

- Enabling the app's passcode feature for additional protection
- Regularly backing up your data using the export feature
- Keeping your device's operating system updated

#### Q: Can I set a password to protect the app?
**A:** Yes! You can enable passcode protection in Settings > Privacy & Security. This will require a 4-digit code every time you open the app.

⚠️ **Important**: Once set, the passcode cannot be recovered or reset. If you forget it, you will lose access to the app and your data.

#### Q: The app won't open or crashes on startup
**A:** Try these steps:
1. Force close the app and reopen it
2. Restart your device
3. Make sure you're running the latest version of the app
4. If you recently set a passcode, try entering it again

6. Reinstall the app (⚠️ Export data first!)

If the problem persists, contact support with:
- Device model and operating system version
- App version

3. Verify the reminder date/time is set correctly
4. Make sure "Do Not Disturb" mode isn't blocking notifications
5. On iOS, check Settings > Notifications > LifeGo
6. On Android, check Settings > Apps > LifeGo > Notifications

#### Q: I can't export my data
**A:** Try these solutions:
1. Make sure you have granted storage/file access permissions

5. Restart your device and try again

#### Q: The app is running slowly
**A:** Performance tips:
1. Restart the app

**Prevention**: We strongly recommend:
