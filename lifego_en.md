# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: January 2026**

## 1. Data Storage

LifeGo is a completely offline application. All your data is stored locally on your device. We do not collect, transmit, or store any of your personal information on remote servers.

## 2. Data Collection

We do not collect any user data. All information you enter into the app (health records, vehicle information, bills, pet information, etc.) remains solely on your device.

## 3. Third-Party Services

LifeGo does not integrate any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services. Your usage patterns and data are never shared with any third parties.

## 4. Device Permissions

The app may request the following permissions:
- **Storage**: To save your data locally
- **Notifications**: To send you reminders you've set
- **Camera (optional)**: To attach photos to records

All permissions are used solely for app functionality and your data never leaves your device.

## 5. Data Security

Since all data is stored locally on your device, your data security depends on your device's security measures. We recommend:
- Setting up device lock (password/PIN/biometric)
- Regularly backing up your data using the app's export feature
- Keeping your device updated

## 6. Data Backup and Export

You can export your data at any time using the app's built-in export feature. This creates a backup file that you can store securely. We are not responsible for data loss if you haven't created backups.

## 7. Children's Privacy

Our app does not collect any data from anyone, including children under 13. Since all data stays on the device, there are no privacy concerns related to children's data.

## 8. Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in app updates. Continued use of the app after updates constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.
