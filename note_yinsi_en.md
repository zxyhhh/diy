### Privacy Policy for LockNote

Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how LockNote ("we", "our", or "the app") handles your information.

#### 1. Information We Do NOT Collect

LockNote is designed with privacy in mind. We do NOT collect, store, or transmit any of your personal information to external servers. Specifically:

- We do NOT collect your name, email, or contact information
- We do NOT track your location
- We do NOT collect device identifiers for tracking purposes
- We do NOT use analytics or advertising tracking
- We do NOT share any data with third parties

#### 2. Local Data Storage

All your task data is stored locally on your device only:

- **Tasks and Reminders**: All tasks, deadlines, and reminder settings are saved locally on your device
- **User Preferences**: App settings and language preferences are stored locally
- **No Cloud Sync**: Your data never leaves your device unless you explicitly use device backup features (iCloud, Google Drive, etc.)

#### 3. Permissions We Request

The app may request the following permissions to provide its functionality:

- **Notifications**: To send you reminders for your tasks at scheduled times
- **Lock Screen Access** (iOS only): To display your tasks on the lock screen using Live Activities

These permissions are used solely to provide the core functionality of the app and do NOT involve any data collection.

#### 4. Data Security

Since all data is stored locally on your device:

- Your task information is protected by your device's security features
- We recommend keeping your device locked with a passcode or biometric authentication
- If you delete the app, all local data will be permanently removed

#### 5. Children's Privacy

LockNote does not knowingly collect any information from children under the age of 13. The app is suitable for all ages.

#### 6. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the app and on this page.
