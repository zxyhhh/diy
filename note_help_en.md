#### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: Why don't I see my tasks on the lock screen?**  
A: Make sure you've marked tasks as "Urgent" in the app. Due to widget limitations, the lock screen widget can only display the first 4 tasks.

**Q: How do I set up recurring reminders?**  
A: When creating or editing a task, tap the reminder icon and select your preferred repeat interval (daily, weekly, or monthly).

**Q: Can I use ScreenDo on Android?**  
A: The Android version is not yet available. Stay tuned for updates.

**Q: How do I change the app language?**  
A: ScreenDo automatically uses your device's system language. We support 10 languages: English, 简体中文, 繁體中文, Français, 日本語, 한국어, Español, Português, Deutsch, and Русский.

**Q: My tasks aren't syncing. What should I do?**  
A: ScreenDo stores all data locally on your device. There is no cloud sync. If you switch devices, you'll need to manually recreate your tasks.

**Q: How do I delete completed tasks?**  
A: Swipe left on any task and tap the delete icon. Completed tasks can be found in the "Completed" section.
